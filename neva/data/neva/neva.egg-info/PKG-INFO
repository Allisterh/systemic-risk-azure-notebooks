Description: This is an implementation of the Neva framework 
                               introduced in https://ssrn.com/abstract=2795583. Neva 
                               allows to perform the valuation of equities of banks 
                               that hold cross-holding of debt. Several known 
                               contagion algorithms (e.g. Furfine, Eisenberg and Noe, 
                               and Linear DebtRank) are special cases of Neva.
